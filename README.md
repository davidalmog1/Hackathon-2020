The Product: Automation Environment integrity check.

The Team: 
David Almog : Main control Flow & Networking functions | Vadim: Parsing & analyze Data | Alon: Parsing & analyze Data

The Problem:
Environments need to be checked before testing, in order to verify 
that the machines(Any Linux Machine) are up to date with all the 
requirements the user set.
There are some basic requirements for every environment, but some 
need a deeper level of customization, A test environment will have 
a different standard for what is critical for B.

Solution â€“ Design: 
Looking at the problem, we created a Monitoring tool that can be highly 
customizable yet built with basic out of the box operations.
    
Technology we used:
Python | XML | HTML
